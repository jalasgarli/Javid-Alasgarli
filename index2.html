       <p> Technology has the ability to impact people's lives at a level that has never been realized in the history of humankind. The idea that we could create something that can impact someone across the world now or in the future is what drives our passion for technology. </p>

        <h4>Hour of Code Project</h4>
       <p1>Team <strong>404!</strong> has successfully conducted the "Hour of Code" project at Sumqayit Secondary School No.1. Our team wanted to show that anyone can learn the basics of coding. Together with 30 students of 7th grade, we completed 20 exercises that helped them to nurture their problem-solving skills, logic, and creativity.</p1> <br><br>

        <p1> We set certain goals we aimed to meet by the end of the project and discussed several topics related to the technology world. Also, our members gave students introductory information about the basics of coding. After that, they started to solve the puzzle problems presented in a game form that contained various blocks of codes.  Students not only had fun solving these problems but also learned new concepts. Together, we solved all the problems of varying complexity.</p1> <br><br>

         <h4>Robotics Project</h4>
           <p1>We use the third generation of LEGO robots to make our model behave in a certain way. Our team already got together and discussed certain aspects of our project. After installing the special software for programming our robot, we started to write our program. We are not given a real robot during the development process, that is why we have to consider many things, as many programmers did before. We are not finished with the project yet but we will <strong>stay inspired till the end!</strong></p1><br>
         <p1>The videos below serve as an inspiration for us:</p1> <br><br>

          <h5>Our Website Project</h5> 
          <p1>We were able to create this website with the help of Codeacademy HTML, CSS and JavaScript courses. Each member of our team tried to make this website as unique and interesting as possible trying different code combinations and selecting the best ones. Here are the links to our individual Codecademy profiles:
